# Statistical_Modeling
This Github Repo contains R code, written analysis, and the datasets for these analytics projects.
I decided to upload the project reports as pdf files since I feel like this is the best way to show the important aspects of the projects and what I learned from them, as opposed to just uploading the R code and dataset which lacks a lot of contexts.

## Project 1: Salary vs Education - Linear Regression
This project examines a dataset where twins report each others' hourly wage and level of education. I created a linear regression model to predict hourly wage based on level of education, and also checked the validity of the model.

## Project 2: Predicting Medical Expenses using Multiple Regression
I used a linear regression model with multiple predictor variables to predict a patient's expected medical expenses based on their information (i.e. age, BMI, smoke, number of children, etc). I also did a correlation study on how the variables can correlate to one another.

## Project 3: Detecting Cancerous Tumors Using Logistic Regression
I used a logistic regression model to classify if a tumor is benign or malignant. The dataset has a wide variety of features for the tumors, so I used hypothesis testing and ANOVA to filter out the significant variables for the model. Through this process, I was able to improve the model's accuracy. Accuracy was measured from a confusion matrix that compared the predicted values to the actual values.

## Project 4: Time Series Forecasting on Monthly CO2 Levels


## Project 5: Machine Learning Classification Models
